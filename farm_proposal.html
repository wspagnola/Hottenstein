Hottenstein Mansion Farm Site Proposal
Hottenstein Reunion Committee
January 2022
Challenge
The Hottenstein Mansion, a property of the Preservation Trust of Berks County,  is a significant historic site considered the finest eighteenth century Pennsylvania German Georgian-style farmhouse built in America. Across four generations of  Hottenstein expansion, seven farms and a one room schoolhouse rose from a cluster of  contiguous properties assembled by Jacob Hottenstein who settled in this location the  1720s. For nearly 300 years this area of Hottenstein settlement has survived  surrounded by cultivated fields, providing homes for many Hottenstein generations who  have provided for and maintained the farming heritage of this region. At the core of  these family farmsteads stands the Hottenstein Mansion, a property of national historic  significance due to its high style Georgian design and Pennsylvania German elements  and craftsmanship.
A proposal the create Valley Logistics Park, a large warehouse project that will  convert most of the open fields near the mansion to an industrial land use, along with  the necessary road widenings, historic building demolitions, and traffic improvements  on Route 222, will significantly reduce the architectural and agricultural context of the  mansion. A plan to mitigate the impact and threats on the Hottenstein Mansion is the  subject of this report.
Vision
Should the warehouse project obtain all needed approvals, the least effected  view of the Hottenstein mansion will be the east side and rear as seen while driving  towards Kutztown on Route 222 south. This view of the property can remain largely as  it looks now with the mansion and outbuildings surrounded on two sides by active farm  fields. The donation of a minimum of ten tillable acres, as well as land to build an  event parking lot, would ensure this property would meet the legal definition of a farm in Pennsylvania. A zoning change needs to be made to agriculture for the entire  property to have the zoning consistent with the use of the land.
The tract of farmland will serve as a frame for the mansion and outbuildings and  with the establishment of hedgerows around these fields, and a row of street trees  along Route 222, that frame will grow to separate the Hottenstein Farm from the new  industrial land uses. On the west side of the property closest to the development  landscaping and fencing will be needed to secure and buffer the mansion property from  light, sound, vibration, and air pollution. This landscaping would help to screen the  warehouses while providing the strongest agricultural contextual frame possible, for the  public to see and appreciate this landmark farmhouse, in an area that is all-
1
encompassing of the area from Route 222 north, to and inclusive of the unnamed  tributary of the Saucony Creek, which flows a few hundred yards behind the mansion  parallel to Route 222, and its associated creek environs.
The Hottenstein Mansion Farm Site Proposal includes important improvements  including an event parking lot, a pathway from that parking lot to the mansion,  extensive landscaping and buffering on the west side closest to the development, a new  Hottenstein Road entrance, a possible driveway relocation, and placement of a  relocated wagon house to protect the mansion from vehicle impact that can be added in  carefully, to not adversely impact the best views of the property, while meeting the new  conditions and needs of changing land use on the former fields. This proposal is  accompanied with a schematic diagram showing the respective locations of the described site improvements. The siting of these improvements will provide for an  ongoing visual and experiential relationship to the agricultural heritage of the  Hottenstein Mansion.
Landscape Architect Needed
The transformation of the Hottenstein property to be a historic farm site is  complicated and needs to be managed by a skilled landscape architect with expertise in  historic site preservation and restoration. While engineering and site work can be  carried out by the developer, the hiring of a historic landscape architect to oversee the  creation of a plan that meets the goals of the Trust and the Reunion Committee will be  important in monitoring and facilitating the plan implementation.
Event Parking Lot
To make the event parking lot less visible, the ideal location is between the  mansion lot, the roundabout, and the new event entrance driveway placed off the  relocated Hottenstein Road, in combination with aggressive landscaping designed to cut  the sight and sound of the trucks entering and leaving the warehouses, fencing, and a  gate to provide security to the site. With the moving of Hottenstein Road away from  the mansion, a larger area will be available in this location to tuck in the event parking lot. The lot could encroach onto the portion of the mansion lot bordering the vacated  section of Hottenstein Road.
The event lot will require grading and drainage engineering. Parking lot space  sizing should be ten feet wide by twenty feet long to increase ease of backing in and  out and to accommodate large vehicles. A cut limestone walkway could connect the  new parking area to the side of the summer kitchen where an iron gate will open to  offer mansion access to parkers at the west kitchen wing side door. Lighting at ground  level for the steps, one or more pole lights for the parking area, and possibly a security  light(s) are needed in case any event occurs past sun set.
2
Handicapped parking can be located on the existing driveway. During an event,  elderly and handicapped guests should park in the house driveway at the existing  garage so the affected passengers can get very close to the east kitchen wing side door safely and on a flat grade. Assigning handicapped cars to the mansion driveway can  reduce the number of parking spaces needed in the event lot by 4-6. Fifty parking  spots, in the new lot and the handicapped spots closer to the mansion is the number  needed for events.
Roundabout/Hottenstein Road Screening, and Security The greatest impact on the mansion property is the light, sound, and emissions  from the entrance turn into the warehouse project from 222 to Hottenstein Road. The  most intensive and densest landscaping used here will shield the mansion property as  best as possible. Integration of the guest parking with this landscaping will minimize  the visual impact of a parking area. The west perimeter of the new lands is closest to  the around the clock warehouse activity. For security, a wooden fence of historic  design should span the border along the new Hottenstein Road from Route 222 to the  northwestern corner of the property. The design can be determined later in  consultation with all stakeholders. A gate to close off the event parking lot can open  manually unless this drive becomes the only way to access the property, then an  electric gate will be needed for security.
Driveway Scenarios
A final plan for access to the site awaits PennDOT completion of a final design for improvements to Route 222. Here are the three possibilities that might occur:
1. If existing driveway remains it needs paving for snow removal. The event lot will  need its own entrance road and security gate, but the two lanes into the site, from the  event entrance and the existing driveway will not need to connect so as to protect site  security.
2. If the existing driveway closed, but Charles Wessner’s drive remains open, construct a paved driveway from the existing mansion lot, along 222, towards the corner of the  new property to provide 222 access closer to the Wessner’s drive, but on Trust property  as granted by PennDot.
3. If there is no access from 222, all vehicles would need to enter the property by the  new Hottenstein Road, and a lane would be needed to connect the event parking lot  area to the existing driveway and garage.
To protect the intact farm fields from this site work and maintain the agricultural  integrity, any connecting road between the event lot and the existing mansion lot should be along the back lot line of the existing small mansion tract, and along the  edge of the fields. Such a route would follow the property line east, then turn into the  backyard and connect with the current driveway. One benefit of this approach is the
3
handicap access would be an extension of the normal entrance procedure. Cutting  through the back yard will require the removal of an abandoned underground fuel oil  tank, installed to power a furnace to heat a greenhouse, since removed. The new road  network on site will need appropriate landscaping.
222 Street Trees, Hedgerow Plantings, and Fencing There is a section of remnant hedgerow left along the field boundary with  Haldeman Ford – let that section serve as a model for reestablishing field hedgerows  along the north rear field boundary with the warehouse project, and along the east side  boundary with Haldeman and Wesner. The hedgerow approach can also be used to  influence the western side plantings of the property with the development. Across the  222 boundary in front of the mansion, a picket fence will be installed with a gate across  from the front door. A fence that appears in a 1890s photo has been reproduced  around the domestic outbuildings on site and will serve as the model. A row of street  trees along 222 and in front of the mansion, species to be determined by research,  would provide security from errant vehicles. Fencing along the west side by Hottenstein Road adds greater security.
Wagon House
Gaining agricultural acreage will allow the Hottenstein Mansion to become the  Hottenstein Farm. There is a need for a large outbuilding to help facilitate farm  operations, reunions, and other special events. Currently the wagon house/corn crib  across 222 from the Mansion is slated for demolition. We propose moving the building  across the road and siting it near the extant parking lot of the mansion and placing it to  help protect the mansion from being struck by errant vehicles. A relocated wagon  house would serve as a sound, sight, and vehicle block – it would look like it belongs  there. We request the developer to move and restore the building. The wagon house  could hold farm machinery to work the ten acres, as well as seed, fertilizers, and  equipment needed for farming. During the reunions tables and chairs in the wagon  house could put the meal under a roof in the shade and provide storage for equipment  needed when large groups gather. The wagon house would need a new foundation  and exterior restoration by the developer. Electricity needs to be run underground to  the wagon house.
Cider Mill
The cider mill is an eighteenth-century timber frame building. The roof is good,  but not of a historically correct material. The exterior is covered in asbestos shingles  that need mitigation and removal. The developer can remediate the asbestos and restore the exterior appearance. Upon removal of the asbestos the building can be  studied to determine how the exterior ought to be restored. The east gable wall was
4
removed to install a garage door making this elevation a challenge to restore.  Electricity needs to be run underground to the cider mill.
Salvage Opportunities
On the side of the weathered wood stable siding across from the twin  Hottenstein Houses is a hand painted tobacco advertisement that we should remove,  conserve, and hang on the side of the wagon house. The two datestones on the stone  houses need to be integrated into the mansion site. The cut stones from the 1835  Hottenstein farmhouse façade might be used for pathways. Other opportunities to  utilize fabric from all buildings being removed by the developer may be identified as a  site plan gets created. A Blue Highway of History sign from the PHMC is needed for the  mansion, as is signage to direct visitors to and through the site.
Farm Operation Agreement
A way to pay for the maintenance and preservation of the added acreage,  structures, and buildings needs discussion. Ideally, upon completion, the developer will  have completed all aspects of the site work and restoration of the cider mill and wagon
house in consultation with the Trust and the Reunion Committee. Since the farmland  can be rented, a modest income can be created to apply to the costs of maintaining the  new property. Because the Trust is a 501C3 non-profit organization, a full tax  exemption should be sought for the farmland. The amount of taxes the developer will  be covering is so large that the associated small reduction in taxes should be  accommodated. The tax savings would boost the annual income to be used to maintain  the property and would provide the basis of establishing a maintenance fund using the  rental income. The tenant and reunion committee, on behalf of the Trust, can manage  the added property in providing for and maintaining the agricultural viewshed.
