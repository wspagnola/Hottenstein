# Hottenstein Family Website 

### Background Info 
- This is a website I designed for my family heritage.  
- My ancestor, Jacob Hottenstein, emigrated from Germany to the colony of Pennsylvania in the 18th century.
-  He was part of the immigration group later known as the Pennsylvania Dutch.
- Most people today associate the term Pennsylvania Dutch with the Amish and Mennonites.
However, the Amish and Mennonites were only a subset of the Pennsylvania Dutch. 
- Some people prefer the term Pennsylvania Germans since most of these immigrants were from what is now part of Germany. For more, information you can check out the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch).
- Jacob built a home in Maxatawney, Pennsylvania .  The home still exists today and is on the National Register of Historical Places. A professor from nearby Kutztown University resides in the house and is in charge of its restoration and preservation.
You can learn more about the house on the [Hottenstein House website](http://www.historicpreservationtrust.org/historic-properties/hottenstein-house/).

### Website Purpose
- Provide a copy of the Annual Newsletter as a pdf
- Describe genealogical information including biographical information about the original Hottenstein settlers
- Provide information about upcoming events and trips including the annual reunion in Pennsylvania.  
- Provide forms for members of the family to submit updated genealogical information.
