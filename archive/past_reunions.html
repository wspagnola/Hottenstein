              With an abundance of caution and consistent with national and state practices for
              protection in the public health crisis associated with the coronavirus, the Pennsylvania

              Your Leadership Group for the Pennsylvania Hottenstein Reunion, in their concerns for the
              well-being of everyone, believed that there were just too many known and unknown factors
              and concerns that could prevail at the Reunion time to proceed with the Reunion.
            </p>
            <p>
              We now look forward to the next Pennsylvania Hottenstein Reunion, which will be next year.
              The date is June 13, 2021, the second Sunday in June 2021.
